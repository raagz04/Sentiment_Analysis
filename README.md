SENTIMENT ANALYSIS PROJECT

Description:
The Sentiment Analysis Project is a data-driven endeavor aimed at analyzing and predicting sentiment in text data using machine learning techniques. The system processes textual data from various sources, such as movie reviews or social media comments, to classify sentiment as positive or negative. Machine learning models, particularly deep learning models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, are trained on labeled data to learn patterns in text and make sentiment predictions automatically.

Key Components:
Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Text data, such as movie reviews, is loaded and preprocessed to remove noise and irrelevant information.
Preprocessing involves steps like lowercasing, removing special characters, and tokenization.
Model Development:

LSTM-based neural networks are utilized to capture sequential dependencies in text data.
The model architecture includes embedding layers for representing words, LSTM layers for sequence learning, and output layers for sentiment classification.
Training and Evaluation:

The models are trained on labeled text data, optimizing for accuracy in sentiment classification.
Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and loss are employed to assess model performance.
Sentiment Prediction:

Trained models are used to predict sentiment in new text data.
Predictions are made on unseen text data to classify sentiment as positive or negative.
Technical Skills Utilized:
Text preprocessing techniques including tokenization and cleaning.
Deep learning frameworks like Keras for building and training LSTM-based models.
Python programming for implementing the project components.
Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy and loss.
